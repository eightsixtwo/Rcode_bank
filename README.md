# Rcode_bank

In this repository you will find various R code snippets that I find useful.

1. Load Packages Tool - This is a simple function that combines install.packages() and library() into one easy function.  Best part about it is that it checks to see if the package is installed first and only installs packages that are not!

2. db Connection settings (PostreSQL) - this contains the code necessary to set up a connection between RStudio and a local instance of PostreSQL.  It uses the RPostgres package to create the connection and can easily be changed to connect to a cloud instance of postgres.
